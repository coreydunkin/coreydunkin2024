### Interactive Resume Page

The `/resume` route showcases a special implementation that combines several advanced techniques:

```typescript
// Responsive print styling for PDF generation
@media print {
  @page {
    size: A4;
    margin: 0.5cm;
  }
  body {
    -webkit-print-color-adjust: exact;
    print-color-adjust: exact;
  }
}
```

- **Custom Print Styling**: Specifically designed for clean PDF export

- **Rich Text Rendering**: Custom component for Contentful's rich text format
- **PDF Generation**: Client-side PDF creation from the rendered page
